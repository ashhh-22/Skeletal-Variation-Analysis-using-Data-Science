# Skeletal-Variation-Analysis-using-Data-Science
The comparison of skeletons across species lead to historical insights in evolutionary biology. In this project, you will explore the bones of the human body and make comparisons to a wide variety of mammals and birds.

# Skeletal Variation Analysis using Data Science 🦴📊

This project investigates skeletal variation across different specimens or populations using Python-based data analysis. The aim is to uncover meaningful patterns in bone measurements and understand biological or anthropological differences.

## 📌 Overview

Understanding skeletal variation is essential in fields like anthropology, archaeology, forensic science, and biology. In this notebook, we perform:

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualization of skeletal measurements
- Dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA)
- Clustering or classification (if applicable)

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset likely includes skeletal metrics (lengths, widths, ratios, etc.) collected from various individuals or groups.

| Column Name      | Description                        |
|------------------|------------------------------------|
| `Specimen_ID`    | Unique identifier for each subject |
| `Femur_Length`   | Length of femur bone               |
| `Humerus_Length` | Length of humerus bone             |
| `Group`          | Categorical label (e.g., species)  |
